the droplets bead on
trailing down her temples

the tears well up
and she hopes so badly
that they do not fall

the skyâ€™s clouds clump and disperse
as they whisper about their neighbors
do not trust them

the grass blades whistle
in the wind as they dance
the more they grow the further they slouch

the petals of the sunflowers
layer and touch and fall
singing songs of the sunlight

as summer comes on
and spring fades away

she sits in the beating heat
and says goodbye to her mother
and she welcomes her grief

as the birds sing her lullabies
to sleep
